# Codecademy Off-Platform Project: Excursion
## By John Clary

This project is part of the "Learn Git and Github" course on Codecademy. HTML and CSS were used to create a landing page for a fictional mobile app called Excursion. Git and Github were used to track changes to the project, and the final site was deployed using Github Pages.

A mockup for the site was provided as well as an additional mockup which included instructions for styling. An example of the finished website was also provided for reference.

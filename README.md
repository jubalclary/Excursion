# Codecademy Off-Platform Project: Excursion
## By John Clary

This project is part of the "Learn Git and Github" course on Codecademy. I used HTML and CSS to create a landing page for a fictional mobile app called Excursion. Git and Github were used to track changes to the project, and the final site was deployed using Github Pages.
